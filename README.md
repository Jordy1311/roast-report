# RoastReport

I love coffee ...maybe too much. I've had a lot of different roasts, from different roasters, brewed with different equipment, following different recipies. I needed a thing to keep track of all that and being a developer I made the non-sensical decision to make a whole app dedicated to this issue.

This is a coffee roast tracking app. At the moment it only keeps track of the different roasts you've had by different roasters but I'm planning on expanding it to also keep track of recipies you've followed to brew each roast.

The goal?
- Have a place to come back and find those amazing roasts you've had in the past
- Have a record of how exactly you brewed those roasts

## Building and running yourself

It is deployed and you should be able to find a link under the short description on the right but if you did want to run it yourself to have a look or something, here are some steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `yarn` to install packages
3. Run `npx ng serve` which will build, serve and watch for changes
4. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

There is a variables file which has the backend url. You could pull and run the backend as well but you'd need even more env vars and set up so just leave it pointing at my deployed api.
